# misc-python
Random assortment of python files, a bit of a mess, but generally things i like to do in my free time, none of them are user friendly

Explanation below

* albion-bot
Bot using openCV to identify certain minerals and click on them (not very good)
* bloons-bot
Bot to play a specific map over and over again on bloons TD 6 (works pretty well)
* poe-bot
Prototype of a bot in path of exile to just walk around the map (not working)
* select-poe-inventory
Clicks the entire player inventory, very basic
* textExtractor
Extracts text from images. You can click two times to crop the area it will use (i'm proud of this)
